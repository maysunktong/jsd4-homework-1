    <h4>
      May grew up in a small rural village where she spent most of her childhood
      reading Harry Potter books and teaching herself computer skills. Her
      passion for both led her to pursue a degree in computer science at a
      university in Bangkok, where she hopes to someday develop technology that
      will make education more accessible to kids like her back home.

      Autumn leaves falling, 🍂
      Crisp air and colors changing, 🌬️
      Nature's art displayed. 🎋
